# suspended_GNR_noise
The program calculates the pumping current (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_stirring,_ratchets,_and_pumping) arising from the flexural movement of a graphene nanoribbon (GNR). The theory can be found in Physical Review B 108, 245408 (2023) (see https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.108.245408  or https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10560).
The program is based on kwant library. So install it first! 
You don't need to touch the main program at all. Every detail of the calculation is controlled by modifying the text file graphene-v12p3_corriente.inp
